# Testing Workflow

Find **Testing Workflow** information in the [PROJECT OVERVIEW](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) file to get the testing workflow of the project.

## Skip-Testing

This project does not require writing tests for the code. Focus on writing clean, well-structured, and maintainable code without worrying about test coverage or test organization.

## Code-First

Tests should be written after the implementation code, following the Code-First approach. This allows developers to focus on building the functionality first and then writing tests to verify that the code works as intended.

## Test-First

Tests should be written before the implementation code, following the Test-First approach. This encourages developers to think about the desired behavior and edge cases before writing the actual code, leading to better-designed and more robust implementations.

## Note for Code-First and Test-First

- Always refer [aaa-testing](../aaa-testing/SKILL.md) skill for best practices on structuring tests, including the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern, common test organization strategies, and guidelines for writing clear and maintainable tests.
- Always refer [playwright-cli](../playwright-cli/SKILL.md) skill for best practices on using Playwright for end-to-end testing, including test organization, writing effective tests, managing test data, and integrating Playwright into the development workflow (verify UI against expected requirements).
